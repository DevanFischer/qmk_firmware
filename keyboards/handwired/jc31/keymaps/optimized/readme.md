Colemak-ish
===========

This layout was inspired by the Colemak keyboard layout. It obviously is an
adaptation because there are only 15 character keys available on the JC31.

LetterFrequency.org was consulted to determine how to get the most bang for the
buck. Digraph and Trigraph frequencies were considered in addition to the English
letter frequency.
