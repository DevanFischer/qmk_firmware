Possible changes
================

* Convert to a double space. The enter keys would move to the Raise and Lower keys.
* Make the rolling delete/backspace code work on any key. We can do this by creating
  a RD_LEFT and RD_RGHT key, then a RD_LEFT_ACTUAL and RD_RGHT_ACTUAL macro that is
  defined by the user.
